# Getting Started

## ‚öí Requirements

- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) - I personally like Hack Nerd Font
- Terminal with true color support (for the default theme, otherwise it is dependent on the theme you are using)
- A clipboard tool is necessary for the integration with the system clipboard
- Brew GCC on apple devices
- Node.js and npm installed

Brew GCC should override apple gcc in macbooks. Easiest method I found is to prioritize `/usr/local/bin` over `/usr/bin` in the PATH variable and Symlinking `/opt/homebrew/bin/gcc-14` as gcc in that path.

## üëã Installation

This configuration has been tested only on unix devices. Please open a PR if tested and working on windows.

`git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:rithulkamesh/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`

## üîß Extending Configuration

The configuration is designed to be easily customizable through a user directory structure. To add your own customizations:

1. Create a new directory structure:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua/rithulkamesh/user
   ```

2. Create your configuration file:

   ```bash
   touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/rithulkamesh/user/init.lua
   ```

3. Add your custom configurations to `init.lua`. Here are some examples:

   ```lua
   require("snippets.lua") --  add custom snippets
   ```

The user configuration will be automatically loaded if it exists, allowing you to extend or override the base configuration without modifying the core files.
